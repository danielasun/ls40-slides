  <h3>Experiment & Observational study</h3>
  <p class="quoted">
    An
    <span class="u-danger">experiment</span> is a study in which the researcher <span class="danger">actively controls one or more of the explanatory variables</span>. <br><br>
    An <span class="u-pop">observational study</span> is a study in which the researcher does not actively control the value of any variable but simply <span class="pop">observes and record the values as they naturally exist</span>.

      This was not a true experiment since Snow did not randomly allocated people into two groups, one exposed to contaminated water and the other not.
      <br>
      Clearly, this would have been unethical and certainly illegal. He did, however, recognize that allocation and near-randomization had taken place in a natural setting, and had taken advantage of this historical occurrence to test his hypothesis.
