  <h3>The use of linear regression analysis</h3>
  <p>
    There are 3 major uses for regression analysis:
  </p>
  <p class="framed border-pop">
    <span class="pop em u strong">Causal analysis</span>: it might be used to identify the <span class="pop">strength of the effect</span> that the independent variable(s) have on a dependent variable. Typical questions are what is the strength of relationship between dose and effect, sales and marketing spend, age and income, etc...
  </p>
  <p class="framed border-info">
    <span class="info em u strong">Forecasting</span>: it can be used to forecast <span class="info">effects or impacts of changes</span>. That is regression analysis helps us to understand how much will the dependent variable change, when we change one or more independent variables. Typical questions are how much additional $Y$ would I get for one additional unit $X$.
  </p>
  <p class="framed border-danger">
    <span class="danger em u strong">Prediction</span>: it can be used to predict <span class="danger">trends and future values</span>. The regression analysis can be used to get point estimates. Typical questions are what will the price for gold be in 6 month from now? What is the total effort for a task X?
