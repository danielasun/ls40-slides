    One goal of statistical significance testing is to rule out random
    chance as <span class="danger">plausible</span> (believable)

      - Could Buzz see the light through the curtain?<br>

    One option that Dr. Bastian pursued was to redo the study except
    now he <span class="orange">replaced the curtain with a wooden barrier</span> between the two
    sides of the tank in order to ensure more complete separation
