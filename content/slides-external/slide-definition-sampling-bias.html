  <h3>Sampling bias</h3>
  <p class="quoted">
    <span class="danger">Sampling bias</span> occurs when the 
    <span class="danger">method of selecting</span> a sample causes
    the <span class="danger">sample to differ from the population</span>
    in some relevant way. If sampling bias exists, then we <span class="u-danger">cannot trust
    generalizations</span> from the sample to the population.
  </p>
  <p class="framed down-2">
    To avoid sampling bias, we try to obtain a sample that is 
    <span class="orange">representative</span> of the population. 
    A representative sample resembles the population, only in smaller 
    numbers. 
    The more representative a sample is, the more valuable the sample 
    is for <span class="orange">making inferences about the population</span>.
