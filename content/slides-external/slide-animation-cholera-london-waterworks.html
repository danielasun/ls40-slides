      London was without cholera from the latter part of 1849 to August 1853. <br>
      During this interval an important change had taken place in the water supply of several of the south districts of London. The Lambeth Company removed their water works in 1852 from opposite Hungerford Market to Thames Ditton [actually Seething Wells]; thus obtaining a supply of water quite free from the sewage of London.
      <br>
      The experiment, too, was on the grandest scale. No fewer than three hundred thousand people of both sexes, of every age and occupation, and of every rank and station, from gentlefolks down to the very poor, were divided into two groups without their choice, and, in most cases, without their knowledge; one group being supplied with water containing the sewage of London, and, amongst it, whatever might have come from the cholera patients, the other group having water quite free from such impurity.
