  <h3>Computing confidence intervals</h3>
  <div class="small">
    The distributions of sample statistics considered so far require us to either already know the value of the population parameter or to have the resources to take thousands of different samples. In most situations, neither of these is an option. <br>
    We usually <span class="info">only have access to the one sample we collected to make inferences about the population</span>.
    How could we estimate the parameter we are interested in and compute the confidence intervals just from this unique sample?

    In practice, instead of actually making many copies of the sample and
