    Thames was very polluted <br>
    By the arrival of the 19th century, the River Thames had become the most contaminated river in the world.
    <br>
    Toilets were widely introduced in London between 1830 and 1850: main sewers were introduced in the 1840s.
    <br>
    The sewers, elongated cesspools with overflows at the end emptied into the River Thames, which was also a dumping ground for animal and industrial wastes.
    <br>
    <br>
    When ship were coming to harbor, crew started to develop cholera symptom only when they were going in contact with people of the city.

      By the middle of the 19th century, Soho had become an insanitary place of cow-sheds, animal droppings, slaughterhouses, grease-boiling dens and primitive, decaying sewers. And underneath the floorboards of the overcrowded cellars lurked something even worse -- a fetid sea of cesspits as old as the houses, and many of which had never been drained. It was only a matter of time before this hidden festering time-bomb exploded.
      <br>
      Soho was the neighborhood of John Snow.
      <br>
      First hand case study for him.
      <br>
      In Snow’s days, the science of public health and statistics, epidemiology, was not established.
      <br>
      He collected epidemiological evidence in a bid to convince other practitioners of his theory of cholera.

      Snow employed network analysis to calculate which water pump was closest to each house.
      <br>
      The stroke of genius: he based it on walking distance, not as-the-crow-flies distance.
      <br>
      He then used polygons to demarcate areas based on those findings. Because he added foot traffic to the equation, the output yielded a shape that clearly illustrated the relationship between human movement and disease.
      <br>
      It was impossible to deny the high concentration of fatalities in the population that was drinking Broad Street water. This map helped convince the local authorities that cholera was waterborne.

      Despite the success of Snow’s theory in stemming the cholera epidemic in Soho, public officials still thought his hypothesis was nonsense.
      <br>
      They refused todo anything to clean up the cesspools and sewers.
      <br>
      The Board of Health issued a report that said, “we see no reason to adopt this belief” and shrugged off Snow’s evidence as mere “suggestions.”
