  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The result of an experiment can be tested by formulating a <span class="danger em">null</span> and <span class="pop em">alternative</span> hypotheses</li>
    <li>By <span class="danger">simulating the null hypothesis</span>, we can compute the probability of observing the result we obtained in the experiment if the null hypothesis was true. (this is the p-value)</li>
    <li>The <span class="danger">p-value</span> provides a measure of the <span class="u-danger">strength of evidence</span> against the null hypothesis.</li>
    <li>A lot of factors can influence the p-value.</li>
