  <h3>Chi-squared ($\chi^2$) statistics</h3>
  <p class="quoted down-3">
    A statistic that is widely used to describe the <span class="danger">difference in distribution patterns of categorical variable(s)</span> is the square of the relative differences of each observed frequencies compared to the expected frequencies. This is known as the <span class="strong">Chi-Squared statistic</span> for comparing frequencies of a categorical variable.

  <div class="center">
    $\chi^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{(\mathrm{Observed}_i-\mathrm{Expected}_i)^2}{\mathrm{Expected}_i}$  
  </div>
  <p>
    $\chi^2$ summarizes the <span class="u danger">discrepancy between observed and expected frequencies</span>:
  </p>
  <ul class="small push-left">
    <li>
      The <span class="orange">smaller the overall discrepancy</span> between the observed and expected scores, the <span class="orange">smaller the value of the $\chi^2$</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
     Conversely, the <span class="pop">larger the discrepancy</span> between the observed and expected scores, the <span class="pop">larger the value of the $\chi^2$</span>.
    </li>
