  <h3>Comparing two groups</h3>
  <div class="small">
    Up to now, when comparing two groups, we considered a null hypothesis relying on the two groups coming from the same population. The question we were answering was:
  </div>
  <div class="small quoted">
    If two samples are drawn from the same population, what is the <span class="pop">chance</span> of finding a <span class="pop">difference this large and larger</span>?
  </div>
  <div class="small right">
    <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right pop"></i> The chance here is quantified by a <span class="pop">p-value</span>

    Null Hypothesis

  <div class="smaller">
    The Null Hypothesis we want to test is that the means, or medians (or any central descriptor of your choosing) are equal, <span class="danger">assuming that the two groups A & B were sampled from the same underlying population <span class="em strong">p</em></span></span> (can have any shape).
  </div>
  <div class="smaller down-1">
    We could write that: $p(x) = p_A(x) = p_B(x)$

        What we've learned so far is the resampling method equivalent to the <span class="danger u">Student's T-Test</span> which tests the difference between the means of two groups, evaluating the null hypothesis that both samples were from the same underlying distribution (theory also assume a normal shaped population, <span class="em">N</span>):

      <div class="center down-1">
        $\mathrm{H}_0: \bar{x}_A = \bar{x}_B | N(\mu_A, \sigma_A) = N(\mu_B, \sigma_B)$

      <div class="down-1">
        <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right"></i> it assumes A and B have the same "true variance". Thus it is called the <span class="em strong">equal variance t-test</em>
      </div>
      <div class="down-3">
        Similar to our $d$ statistic (difference), the T-Test use a t statistic, which has a "standardized" form (normalized in term of SE).
