        Most people are not accustomed to looking at foot length, so describing the suspect as having a foot of 10.5inches long would probably not help find the suspect.

  <p>
    Because the correlation coefficient only gives information about
    the
    <span class="danger">direction</span> and
    <span class="danger">strength</span> of an association,
    we cannot use it
    directly to get information of someone's height from
    his/her footprint.
