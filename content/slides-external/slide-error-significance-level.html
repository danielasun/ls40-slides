  <h3>Significance Level and Errors</h3>
  <p>
    While we wish to avoid both types of errors, in practice 
    <span class="danger">we have to accept some trade-off</span>
     between them:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="fragment">
      If we set <span class="pop strong">$\alpha$ to be very low</span>, we make it very hard to reject H$_0$ and we 
      <span class="u-pop">reduce the chance of making a Type I error
      </span>
      (If we make 
      $\alpha$ smaller, fewer samples would be considered "extreme", meaning we would reject H$_0$ less often),
      but then we would <span class="strong">make Type II errors more often</span>.
    </li>
    <li class="fragment down-2">
      On the other hand, setting a <span class="orange strong">larger $\alpha$</span> makes it easier to reject H$_0$ (more samples would be considered "extreme") and we would <span class="u-orange">reduce the chance of making a Type II error</span>. But we would
      also <span class="strong">increase the chance of making a Type I error</span>, ending up rejecting too many H$_0$â€™s that were actually true. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="framed border-danger bg-danger-light black fragment">
    This balance is set by how easy or hard it is to reject H$_0$, which is exactly <span class="strong">determined by the significance level $\alpha$</span>! 
  </p>

  <h3>Understanding the Significance Level</h3>
  <p class="em">
    The significance level $\alpha$, represents the <span class="success strong">tolerable probability of making a Type I error</span>.
  </p>
  <p class="down-3">
    <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right info"></i>
    <span class="info">If the consequences of a Type I error are severe</span> (for example, approving a new drug that is potentially dangerous) we might use a very small $\alpha$ (perhaps even $\alpha=0.005$).
  </p>
  <p class="down-3">
    <i class="fa fa-arrow-circle-right danger"></i>
    <span class="danger">If the consequences of a Type II error are severe</span> (for example, failing to diagnose a treatable disease), we would want to make it easier to reject $\mathrm{H}_0$, so
    we might use a relatively large $\alpha$.

      <p>
        Remember that there is always a trade-off between the two types of errors, so people usually use the common significance levels of <span class="pop">5%</span>, 10% or 1% (but where the perfect balance lies is a complicated question and the increasing subject of debate).
