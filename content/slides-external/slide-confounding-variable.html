        In an <span class="info">experiment</span>, you actively create the groups by what you choose 
        to do. More formally, you assign the conditions to be compared. These conditions may be one

    assignements. The role of the random assignement is to balance out potentially confounding
    variables among the explanatory variable groups, giving us the potential to draw
    cause-and-effect conclusions. <span class="em muted">(e.g.: you flip a coin before a game to assign if this will be sold-out or not)</span>
