      It is likely that the epidemic had a common source
      <br>
      To better see what was happening, snow placed the data on a map of Soho. Within 250 yards of the spot where Cambridge Street joins Broad Street there were upwards of 500 fatal attacks of cholera in 10 days.
      <br>
      He also added the water sources locations (blue points)
      <br>
      Deaths concentrated around Broad Street pump. Dr. Snow worked around the clock to track down information from hospital and public records on when the outbreak began and whether the victims drank water from the Broad Street pump. Snow suspected that those who lived or worked near the pump were the most likely to use the pump and thus, contract cholera.
      <br>
      But they are also data that are a bit different. Anomalies.
      <br>
      None of the workers at the Broad Street brewery had cholera: they were very close to Broad street pump.
      <br>
      Likewise the Poland Street Workhouse only recorded five deaths among its 535 inmates.
