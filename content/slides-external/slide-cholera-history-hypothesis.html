      Cholera has been one of most virulent killers in history.
      <br>
      Millions succumbed to the 7 cholera pandemics since the first in 1817.
      <br>
      It became the first truly global disease and also the most feared.
      <br>
      Symptoms of this disease include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and a horribly violent case of diarrhea that can cause one to lose as much as 20 liters of fluid and electrolytes per day, leading to extremely severe dehydration.

    <p>Being skeptic, curious, not taking anything for granted is a good quality to have.</p>
    <p>
      The first cases of cholera in England were reported in 1831, about the time Dr. Snow as finishing up his medical studies at the age of eighteen. Between 1831 and 1854, tens of thousands of people in England died of cholera. Although Dr. Snow was deeply involved in experiments using a new technique, known as anesthesia, to deliver babies, he was also fascinated with researching his theory on how cholera spread.
      <br>
      In the middle 1800s, people didn’t have running water or modern toilets in their homes. They used town wells and communal pumps to get the water they used for drinking, cooking and washing.  Septic systems were primitive and most homes and businesses dumped untreated sewage and animal waste directly into the Thames River or into open pits called “cesspools”.  Water companies often bottled water from the Thames and delivered it to pubs, breweries and other businesses.
      <br>
      Dr. Snow believed sewage dumped into the river or into cesspools near town wells could contaminate the water supply, leading to a rapid spread of disease.
      <br>
      In August of 1854 Soho, a suburb of London, was hit hard by a terrible outbreak of cholera. Dr. Snows himself lived near Soho, and immediately went to work to prove his theory that contaminated water was the cause of the outbreak.
