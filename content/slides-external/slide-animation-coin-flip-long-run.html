  <h3>Long-run pattern a single coin-flip</h3>
  <p>
    We really need to simulate this random selection process hundreds, preferably
    <span class="info">thousands of times</span> to obtain the
    <span class="danger">long-run pattern</span> of our simulation.

  <h3>Long-run pattern for 16 coin-flips</h3>
  <p>
    This would be very tedious and time-consuming with coins to obtain the
    long-run distribution of the number of heads for 16 coin-flips, so we'll turn
    to technology to simulate it.

        How many of the simulations produced <span class="danger">15 or more</span> correct choices by Buzz? <br>

        What is the corresponding <span class="pop">proportion of simulations</span> that produced such an extreme result? <br>

    1000 is a number large enough to give us a fairly accurate sense
    of the long-run behavior for the number of heads in 16 tosses.
