  <h3>Sampling distribution: <span class="pop">standard error</span></h3>
  <div class="smaller">
    Knowing <span class="danger">how much a statistic varies from sample to sample</span> (spread of the sampling distribution) is key in helping us know how accurate an estimate is. One measure of variability associated with the sample statistic is to compute the <span class="danger">standard deviation of the sample statistics in the sampling distribution</span>.

        <span class="muted u em">Note:</span> Although this is no different from the standard deviation of sample values, the standard deviation of a sample statistic is so important that it gets its own name: the <span class="bg-pop-light">standard error of the statistic</span> (denoted <span class="pop">SE</span>).

        The different name helps to distinguish between the variability in the sample statistics and the variability among the values within a particular sample.

      We think of the standard error as a “typical” distance between the sample statistics and the population parameter.
