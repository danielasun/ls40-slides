    The UK government’s Cycle to Work scheme allows an employee to purchase a bicycle (up to a cost of $1560) at a significant discount by using tax incentives, provided the bicycle is used for commuting to and from work. The initiative aims to <span class="danger em">promote healthier journeys to work and reduce environmental pollution.</span>

       I purchased a bike at the top end of the cost allowed by the scheme and opted for a <span class="danger">carbon frame</span> because it was significantly lighter than my existing bicycle’s <span class="pop">steel frame</span>.

    One sunny morning, I got to work in 43 minutes, the fastest I could recall. My steel bike was consigned to a corner of the garage to gather dust—until I had a puncture. The next day I was back on my old steel bike. I fitted the cycle computer, set off . . . and discovered I had got to work in 44 minutes. “Hang on,” I thought, <span class="danger">“was that minute worth £950 or was it a fluke?”</span> There was only one answer: a <span class="u-danger">randomized trial</span>.
