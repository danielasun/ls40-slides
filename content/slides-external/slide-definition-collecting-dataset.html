  <h3>Collecting a dataset</h3>
  <p class="quoted" style="font-size: 0.7em; margin-top: 0;">
    The <span class="info">population</span> is the <span class="u-info">entire collection</span> of observational units we are interested in.
    A <span class="danger">sample</span> is a <span class="u-danger">subset of the population</span> on which we record data.
  </p>
  <p class="quoted">
    Numerical summaries about a population are called <span class="info">parameters</span>, and numerical summaries calculated from a sample are called <span class="danger">statistics</span>.

    The size of the sample is important. <br>
    The bigger the sample size, the more likely the data we collect can be generalized to
    the full population.
