  <h3>Studying dolphins mental abilities</h3>

      In the early 1960's the U.S. Navy started a program to study the potential use of marine mammals for military tasks such as ship and harbor protection, mine detection and clearance, and equipment recovery. One of the area of interest for the program was about <span class="danger">understanding dolphins mental abilities</span>.

    A famous study from the 1960s explored whether two dolphins (Doris and Buzz) could
    communicate abstract ideas. Researchers believed dolphins could communicate simple
    feelings like “Watch out!” or “I’m happy,” but Dr. Jarvis Bastian wanted to explore
    whether they could also communicate in a more abstract way, much like humans do.
    To investigate this, Dr. Bastian spent many years training Doris and Buzz and exploring
    the limits of their communicative ability. <br>
    During a training period lasting many months, Dr. Bastian placed buttons underwater on
    each end of a large pool—two buttons for Doris and two buttons for Buzz. He then used an
    old automobile headlight as his signal. When he turned on the headlight and let it shine
    steadily, he intended for this signal to mean “push the button on the right.”
    When he let the headlight blink on and off, this was meant as a signal to “push the button
    on the left.” Every time the dolphins pushed the correct button, Dr. Bastian gave the dolphins
    a reward of some fish. Over time Doris and Buzz caught on and could earn their fish reward
    every time.

    In one phase of the study, Dr. Bastian had Buzz attempt to push the correct button
    a total of 16 different times. <br>
