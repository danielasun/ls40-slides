      This class is a bit different => RESAMPLING & SIMULATIONS.
      <br>
      We believe understanding how things work is far more interesting
      and useful, because it can be applied and tweaked to very specific situations.
      <br>
      Formula have been developed for a certain kind of data.
      <br>
      The problem is that we are living in a rapidly evolving world, with new kind of data being generated every day. We need to be able to analyze this new kind of data.
      Formula applies to a very narrow range of data. We are not living in a fantasy world.
      <br>
      I am not here to train you to be a bunch of robots who know how to apply some recipe by heart and just press a button and just read the results.
      <br>
      I am here is to train the next generation of scientists, the next generation of entrepreneurs,
      the next generation of leader, who will be able to understand to analyze any kind of new data they encounter.

  <h3>Motivation for this class</h3>
  <p class="quoted">
    What we teach is largely the <span class="danger">technical machinery of numerical approximations based on the normal
    distribution</span> and its many subsidiary cogs. 
    This machinery was once necessary, because 
    <span class="fragment highlight-bg-warning"> the conceptually simpler alternative based on permutations was computationally beyond our reach</span> [...]
    <br>
    <br>
    Before computers statisticians had no choice. These days we have no excuse. 
    <span class="fragment highlight-bg-info">Randomization-based
    inference makes a direct connection between data production and the logic of inference</span> that
    deserves to be at the core of every introductory course.‚Äù
