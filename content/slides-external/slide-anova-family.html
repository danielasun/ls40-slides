  <h3>The ANOVA family</h3>
  <p>
    ANOVA is not limited to the study of the effect of one <span class="strong">factor</span> ("One-way ANOVA"). In fact a lot of different other variations of ANOVA exist.
  </p>
  <p class="down-3">
    We will talk about two other ANOVA methods:
  </p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
      <span class="u em danger">Repeated measures ANOVA:</span> the repeated measure ANOVA allows to study and compare the mean scores of different groups in which the observational units are <span class="strong">paired</span> accross all the levels of the factor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="u em danger">Two-way ANOVA:</span>  this is an extension of the One-way ANOVA that allows to examine the influence of <span class="strong">two different categorical independent variables</span> (two factors, each one having 2 or more levels) on one quantitative variable. The two-way ANOVA not only aims at assessing the main effect of each factor but also if there is any <span class="strong">interaction</span> between them.
    </li>
  </ul>
