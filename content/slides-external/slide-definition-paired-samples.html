  <h3>Paired samples</h3>
  <p class="quoted">
    Paired samples (also called <span class="danger">dependent samples</span>) are samples in which natural or matched couplings occur. This generates a dataset in which <span class="u-danger">each data point in one sample is uniquely paired to a data point in the second sample</span>.

  <ul class="smaller up-1">
    <li>There is one pair of response values for each observational units (each sample has the <span class="danger">same number</span> of data points)</li>
    <li>There is a built-in comparison (each data point in one sample is <span class="danger">related to one, and only one</span>, data point in the other sample)</li>

    <li>matching similar individuals to create groups of two: this is referred as <span class="pop">paired design using matching</span>.

        when a paired design is possible, you typically get <span class="orange">more informative results</span> because units within a pair tend to be similar to each other, so differences within such each pair on the response variable tend to be <span class="orange">due mainly to the explanatory variable</span>.

  <h3>Examples of paired samples</h3>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>
      <span class="danger">pre-test/post-test</span> samples in which a factor is measured before and after an intervention.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="danger">cross-over trials</span> in which individuals are randomized to two treatments and then the same individuals are crossed-over to the alternative treatment.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="danger">matched samples</span>, in which individuals are matched on personal characteristics such as age and sex.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="danger">duplicate measurements</span> on the same biological samples.

    <li>
      any circumstance in which each data point in one sample is uniquely matched to a data point in the second sample.
