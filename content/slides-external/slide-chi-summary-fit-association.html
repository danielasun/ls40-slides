    $\chi^2$ is just another <span class="pop">statistic of interest</span>, and the null randomization distribution can be <span class="pop">easily simulated</span>. The <span class="strong em">MAD</span> could be calculated instead.

    The theoretical approach to determine the $\chi^2$ distribution requires the use of the <span class="warning-dark">correct number of degrees of freedom</span> of the contingency table you are studying. Remember that you would also need a <span class="strong">count>10 for all the cells</span> as <span class="warning-dark">validity condition</span> of the theoretical approach.
