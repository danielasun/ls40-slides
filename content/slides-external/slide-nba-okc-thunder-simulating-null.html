    Our strategy will be to determine
    <span class="danger">how surprising the
    observed result would be if the null hypothesis were true
    </span>.
    We can determine this by using simulation to generate a
    large number of "could have been" results under that null
    hypothesis and examine the null distribution of our statistic.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i class="fas fa-arrow-circle-right danger"></i> If the observed result from our investigation falls in one of the
    tails of that distribution, then we have strong evidence against
    the null hypothesis (the probability of it to happen by <span class="danger">random chance alone</span> is very low).
