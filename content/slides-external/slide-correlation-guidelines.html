  <table class="small center">
    <col width=25%>
    <col width=15%>
    <col width=60%>
      <tbody>
        <tr class="bg-muted">
          <td>Correlation<br>(absolute value)</td>
          <td>Strength of association</td>
          <td>What this means</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="bg-danger-light">
          <td>0.7 to 1.0</td>
          <td>Strong</td>
          <td>
            The points will appear to be nearly<br>a straight line
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="bg-warning-light">
          <td>0.3 to 0.7</td>
          <td>Moderate</td>
          <td>
            When looking at the graph the increasing/decreasing pattern will be clear, but it wonâ€™t be nearly a line
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="bg-info-light">
          <td>0.1 to 0.3</td>
          <td>Weak</td>
          <td>
            With some effort you will be able to see a slightly increasing/decreasing pattern
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="bg-success-light">
          <td>0 to 0.1</td>
          <td>None</td>
          <td>
            No discernible increasing/decreasing pattern
          </td>
        </tr>
