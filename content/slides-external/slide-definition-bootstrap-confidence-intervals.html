  <h3>Bootstrap confidence intervals</h3>
  <p class="quoted">
    A bootstrap confidence interval at the <span class="danger">$\alpha$</span>
    level, is computed by considering the
    <span class="danger">central (1-$\alpha$)</span> bootstrap statistics of the
    bootstrap sampling distribution.
  </p>
  <p class="down-3">
    In the <span class="u-pop">sorted array</span> of bootstrap statistics,
    this corresponds to the statistics at positions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="pop">$(\frac{\mathrm{alpha}}{2})^{th}$</span>,
      for the lower confidence interval limit, and
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="pop">$(1-\frac{\mathrm{alpha}}{2})^{th}$</span>,
     for the upper confidence interval limit
   </li>
  </ul>
